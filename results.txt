(note the initial error counts are pre-stub file!  Well, this one is after the stub file for the
previous project)
Initial error count: 458 errors

+30 (0:30): 382.  Marked a few types safe.
+30 (1:00): 73.  Mostly marking things @UIType, a couple @UI Runnables
+15 (1:15): 55.  Marking @UITypes
+15 (1:30): 48.  Marked a couple JFace utility classes @SafeType, plus a new UIType
+15 (1:45): 35.  Mostly marked a couple safe types and packages.
+60 (2:45): 20 (plus 2 warnings about redundant annotations because I haven't fixed the postDirectSupertypes() issue yet).  A few stub fixes, largely marking the AbstractViewAction heirarchy as UITypes.  Could probably replace those with a single package annotation.
+15 (3:00): 10.  Largely marking things like JFaceResources and (shockingly) SWT Font as mostly safe
+15 (3:15): 8.  A UI type, and marking FieldEditor.setPropertyChangeListener as taking a @UI listener
